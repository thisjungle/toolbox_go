clause 19.8.

14.8Attendance at block release training

training for training identified in or associated with their training contract,
and such training requires an overnight stay, the employer must pay for the
excess reasonable travel costs incurred by the apprentice in the course of
travelling to and from such training. Provided that clause 14.8

travel costs includes the total cost of reasonable transportation (including
transportation of tools where required), accommodation costs incurred while
travelling (where necessary) and reasonable expenses incurred while travelling,
including meals, in excess of the fares and travel patterns allowance payable
under clause 26.5(a). For the purposes of clause 14.8(a) excess travel costs do

transit.

**(c)** The amount payable by an employer under clause 14.8(a) may be reduced by an amount the apprentice is eligible to receive for travel
costs to attend block release training under a Government apprentice assistance
scheme. This will only apply if an apprentice has either received such
assistance or their employer has advised them in writing of the availability of
such assistance.

**(d)** Clause 14.8 applies instead of the provisions contained in

authority and any additional requirements of the relevant training package with
respect to the demonstration of competency and any minimum necessary work
experience requirements are met; and

that the abovementioned requirements have been met; or

**(B)** the employer has been provided with written
advice that the RTO has assessed that the apprentice meets the abovementioned
requirements in respect to all the relevant units of competency and the
employer has not advised the RTO and the apprentice of any disagreement with
that assessment within 21 days of receipt of the advice.

**(b)** If the employer disagrees with the assessment of the RTO
referred to in clause 14.9(a)(iii)(B) above, and the dispute cannot be
resolved by agreement between the RTO, the employer and the apprentice, the
matter may be referred to the relevant State/Territory apprenticeship authority
for determination. If the matter is not capable of being dealt with by such
authority it may be dealt with in accordance with the dispute resolution clause
in this award. For the avoidance of doubt, disputes concerning other
apprenticeship progression provisions of this award may be dealt with in
accordance with the dispute resolution clause.

**(c)** For the purposes of clause 14.9, the training package
containing the qualification specified in the contract of training for the
apprenticeship, sets out the assessment requirements for the attainment of the
units of competency that make up the qualification. The definition of “competency”
utilised for the purpose of the training packages and for the purpose of clause
14.9 is the consistent application of knowledge and skill to the standard of
performance required in the workplace. It embodies the ability to transfer and
apply skills and knowledge to new situations and environments.

**(d)** The apprentice will be paid the wage rate referred to in
clause 14.9(a) from the first full pay period to commence on or after the
date on which an agreement or determination is reached in accordance with
clause 14.9(a)(iii) or on a date as determined under the dispute resolution
process in clause 14.9(b).

Ordinary working hours will be 8 hours in duration each day, of
which 0.4 of one hour of each day worked will accrue towards an RDO and 7.6

**(ii)** on a day during a 20 day 4 week cycle during which particular
employees will take their RDOs on different days in accordance with a written
roster fixed by the employer and issued 7 days before the commencement of that

under clause 16.4(a) and in that event the following will apply:

**(a)** The number of accrued RDOs banked must not exceed 5 at any
time.

**(b)** If an accrued RDO is banked, an employee is required to work
on the day the employee’s RDO was otherwise fixed under clause 16.4(a). In that event clause 16.6 does not apply.

**(c)** An accrued RDO that is banked will be taken on a day that is
agreed between the employer and the employee and on which ordinary working

received had the employee taken any accrued RDO yet to be taken and any banked
accrued RDO; and

**(b)** an amount equal to the payment the employee would have
received had the employee taken an RDO for the period representing the number
of hours and minutes that have accrued towards an RDO.

16.8Agreement on working other than the rostered day
off cycle

Where an employer and the majority of employees employed at a
particular enterprise agree that due to the nature of an employer’s operations
it is not practicable for an employee to be provided with an RDO in each 4 week
cycle, they may agree to an alternate method of arranging working hours,
provided that the ordinary hours worked in any one week from Monday to Friday

24.Inclement weather

**24.1** Clause 24 applies to general building and
construction and the civil construction sector only.

**24.2** **Inclement weather** means the existence of rain or abnormal climatic conditions
(whether hail, extreme cold, high wind, severe dust storm, extreme high
temperature or the like or any combination of these conditions) where it is not
reasonable or it is unsafe for employees to continue working in those
conditions.

**24.3** The employer or its representative, when
requested by the employees or their representative, must confer within a
reasonable time (which does not exceed 60 minutes) for the purpose of
determining whether or not the conditions referred to in clause 24.2 apply.

**24.4** The time work stops due to inclement weather
and the resumption of work after a period of inclement weather has ended will
be recorded by the employer.

**24.5** When inclement weather conditions exist an
affected employee is not required to start or continue to work where it is
unreasonable or unsafe to do so. In cases where emergency work is required or
it is necessary to complete a concrete pour already commenced to a practical
stage, work may occur or continue provided that such work does not give rise to
a reasonable concern on the part of an employee undertaking the work of an
imminent risk to their health or safety.

**24.6** Where a concrete pour is completed in
accordance with clause 24.5, work will be paid at the rate of **200%** of the **ordinary hourly rate** calculated to the next hour, and in the case of wet weather, the
employee will be provided with adequate wet weather gear. If an employee’s
clothes become wet as a result of working in the rain during a concrete pour
the employee will, unless the employee has a change of dry working clothes
available, be allowed to go home for the remainder of the day without loss of
pay.

**24.7** Where an employee is not able to perform any
work at any location because of inclement weather, the employee will receive
payment at the **ordinary hourly rate** for ordinary hours. Payment for time lost due to inclement weather
is subject to a maximum of 32 hours pay in any 4 week period for each employee.
Payment is subject to adherence to the terms of clause 24.

**24.8** If an employee commences employment during a 4 week period the employee will be credited with:

**(a)** 32 hours where the employee commences on any working day
within the first week;

**(b)** 24 hours where the employee commences on any working day
within the second week;

**(c)** 16 hours where the employee commences on any working day
within the third week; and

**(d)** 8 hours where the employee commences on any working day
within the 4th week in any 4 week period.

**24.9** The first period will be deemed to commence
on the first Monday after 28 December 2009 and subsequent periods will
commence at 4 weekly periods thereafter, provided that a calendar that was being used immediately before 15 July 2013 may
still apply.

**24.10** An employee working on a part-time basis
pursuant to clause 11—Part-time weekly hire employees, will be
entitled to payment on a pro rata basis according to the number of ordinary
hours agreed to be worked in the 4 week period. The method of calculation of a
part-time daily hire employee’s proportionate employment will be as follows:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 32 x | Number<br>of hours agreed to be worked during the 4 week period |
|  | 152 |

**24.11** Inclement weather occurring during overtime
will not be taken into account for the purposes of clause 24 and employees will not be entitled to any
payment for stoppages because of inclement weather that occurs outside of
ordinary hours.

**24.12** Employees on a portion of a site not
affected by inclement weather must continue to work even though employees
working on other areas of the site may have stopped work because of inclement
weather.

**24.13** Subject to the availability of alternative
work in an employee’s classification, an employer may require employees to
transfer:

**(a)** from a location on a site where it is unreasonable and/or
unsafe to work because of inclement weather, to another area on the same site,
where it is reasonable and safe to work; and/or

**(b)** from a site where it is unreasonable and/or unsafe to work
because of inclement weather, to another site, where it is reasonable and safe
to work, and where the employer, where necessary, provides transport.

24.14Additional wet weather procedure

(a)Remaining on site

Where, because of wet weather, the employees are prevented from
working:

**(i)** for more than an accumulated total of 4 hours of ordinary time in
any one day; or

**(ii)** after the meal break, as provided in clause 18.1,
for more than an accumulated total of **50%** of the normal afternoon work
time; or

**(iii)** during the final 2 hours of the normal work day for more than an
accumulated total of one hour;

the employer will not be entitled to require the employees to
remain on site beyond the expiration of any of the above circumstances.

Where, by agreement between the employer
and the employees, employees remain on site beyond the periods specified above,
any such additional wet time will be paid for but will not be debited against
the employees’ hours. Wet time occurring during overtime will not be taken into
account for the purposes of clause 24.14(a).

(b)Rain at starting time

Where the employees are in the sheds, because they have been
rained off, or because it is at starting time, morning tea, or lunch time, and
it is raining, they will not be required to go to work in a dry area or to be
transferred to another site unless:

**(i)** the rain stops; or

**(ii)** a covered walkway has been provided; or

**(iii)** the sheds are under cover and the employees can get to the dry area
without going through the rain; or

**(iv)** adequate protection is provided.

Protection must, where necessary, be provided for the
employees’ tools.

requirements will be satisfied by contributions made to a superannuation fund
nominated in the award covering the employee, provided the fund is able to
accept contributions for the benefit of the employee.

(d) A fund may not be able to accept contributions for the
benefit of an employee if the employee would be a new member of the fund’s
MySuper product and the MySuper product is closed to new members because it has
failed the performance tests of Australian Prudential Regulation Authority
(APRA) for 2 consecutive years.

**(b)** An employee may adjust the amount the employee has authorised
their employer to pay from the wages of the employee from the first of the
month following the giving of three months’ written notice to their employer.

**(c)** The employer must pay the amount authorised under clauses 28.3(a) or 28.3(b) no later than 28 days after the end of the month in which the
deduction authorised under clauses 28.3(a) or 28.3(b)
was made.

\[28.4 varied by [PR771287](https://www.fwc.gov.au/documents/awardsandorders/pdf/pr771287.pdf) ppc 09Apr24\]

is required to make the superannuation contributions provided for in clause 28.2 to another superannuation fund, the employer must make the superannuation
contributions provided for in clause 28.2 and pay any amount authorised under
clauses 28.3(a) or 28.3(b) to one of the following superannuation funds or its
successor, provided that, in respect of new employees, the fund is able to

**benefit member** of.

28.5Absence from work

Subject to the governing rules of the relevant superannuation
fund, the employer must also make the superannuation contributions provided for
in clause 28.2 and pay the amount authorised under clauses 28.3(a)
or 28.3(b):

**(a)** **Paid leave—** while the employee is on any paid leave;

**(b)** **Work-related injury or illness**—for the period of absence from work (subject to a maximum of 52 weeks) of

take time off, at a time or times specified in the request or to be
subsequently agreed by the employer and the employee, instead of being paid for
overtime worked by the employee. If the employer agrees to the request then
clause 29.13 will apply, including the requirement for separate written
agreements under clause 29.13(c) for overtime that has been worked.

had not been on leave.

**(b)** In addition to the payment prescribed in clause 31.2(a), an employee must be paid during a period of annual leave a loading of **17.5%**

provided for in clause 31.2(b), an employee who would have worked on
shiftwork had they not been on leave and where the employee would have received
shift loadings prescribed by clause 17—Shiftwork, had they not been on leave
during the relevant period and such loadings would have entitled them to a
greater amount than the loading of **17.5%**, then the shift loading as
prescribed in clause 17—Shiftwork will be included in the rate of wage
prescribed by clause 31.2(b) instead of the **17.5%** loading.

taken into account, would eliminate the employee’s excessive leave accrual.

**(c)** A notice given by an employee under clause 31.8(a)
must not:

**(i)** if granted, result in the employee’s remaining accrued entitlement
to paid annual leave being at any time less than 6 weeks when any other paid

A.3Classification principles

A.3.1General

In determining the appropriate classification of a position or
job to be filled by an employee, an employer will pay full regard to:

**(a)** the nature and skill requirements of the position to be filled;

**(b)** the skill level and certification of the employee;

**(c)** the experience and qualifications of the employee in:

**(i)** relevant indicative tasks nominated in clauses A.2.1(d),
A.2.2(c), A.2.3(c), A.2.4(c), A.2.5(c), A.2.6(c), A.2.7(c) and A.2.8(c); and/or

**(ii)** competency standards against which an employee is accredited;

**(d)** any agreed national procedures established for testing the validity
of an employee’s claim for reclassification.

A.3.2Classification/reclassification in the engineering stream

**(a)** Where an employee has the relevant qualification recognised as a
minimum training requirement for the level to which the employee seeks to be
reclassified and they are exercising or are required to exercise the skills and
knowledge gained for the qualification necessary for that level of work, the
employee will be classified appropriately.

**(b)** In the event that there is a claim for reclassification by an
existing employee to a higher level under the new structure on the grounds that
the employee possesses equivalent skill and knowledge gained through on-the-job
experience, the following principles apply:

**(i)** the dispute resolution provisions in 39—Dispute resolution will be
followed;

**(ii)** competency standards will be established through the appropriate
Industry Training Boards, co-ordinated by MSA and for the lift industry the Ee-Oz.
Such standards will be consistent with the requirements of the National
Training Framework Committee for relevant levels in the new classification
structure before claims for reclassification at that level are processed;

**(iii)** procedures will be established for testing the validity of an
employee’s claim for reclassification.

**(c)** Where skill standards have not been finalised in respect of any
class of work and they are necessary for determining an employee’s
classification, employees performing such work will not be reclassified until
such standards are available except as provided for in clauses A.3.2(a) and A.3.2(d) of this Schedule.

**(d)** Where the situation described in clause A.3.2(c)
applies, but not in any other circumstances, an employee may be reclassified on
the basis that the employee meets the requirements of the old classification
definitions in the _National Metal and Engineering On-site Construction_
_Industry Award 2002_.

A.4Skill based career structure

**A.4.1** The classification structure is designed to facilitate the
improvement of the level of skills of the workforce and to provide a career
path for all employees.

**A.4.2** Each classification level builds upon the previous level so that the
value of an employee to the industry and their employer increases as the
employee progresses through the structure. Skills are built up in a sequential
manner through job learnt skills and structured training.

**A.4.3** Under the new classification structure, an employee’s building and
construction industry skills are to be formally recognised, industry wide, at
all levels from new entrant to CW/ECW 8–ECW 9. Employees will move up
the classification structure as they acquire additional accredited skills.
Payment will be on the basis of the level of skills required to perform the
work of a particular position or job offered by an employer.

A.5Training

In order to facilitate the operation of the classification
structure an employer must, in co-operation with the consultative committee
develop a training programme consistent with:

**(a)** the size, structure and scope of the activities of the employer;

**(b)** the need to develop vocational skills relevant to the enterprise and
the building and construction industry generally through courses conducted by
accredited educational institutions and providers.

**(c)** Where, as a result of consultation in accordance with clause A.5
it is agreed that additional training should be undertaken by the employee,
that training may be taken either on or off the job. Provided that if the
training is undertaken during normal working hours the employee concerned will
not suffer any loss of pay. The employer must not unreasonably withhold such
paid training leave.

**(d)** Any costs associated with standard fees for prescribed course and
prescribed textbooks (excluding those textbooks which are contained in the
employers technical library) incurred in connection with the undertaking of
training pursuant to clause A.5(c) will be reimbursed by the employer upon the
production of evidence of such expenditure. Provided that reimbursement will be
subject to the presentation of reports of satisfactory progress.

**(e)** Travel costs incurred by an employee undertaking training in
accordance with clause A.5 which exceed those normally incurred travelling to
and from work will be reimbursed by the employer.

A.6Definitions of classifications in Schedule A

The broadbanded award classifications referred to in clause A.2 of this Schedule will have the meaning ascribed to them by an award made under
the _Workplace Relations Act 1996_(Cth) or a notional agreement
preserving a State award that would have applied to an employee immediately
prior to 1 January 2010; or a Division 2B State award that would have applied
to the employee immediately prior to 1 January 2011.

apprentice is a person who is undertaking an apprenticeship in accordance with
this schedule while also undertaking a course of secondary education.

**C.2** A school-based apprenticeship may be undertaken in the trades
covered by this award under a training agreement or contract of training for an
apprentice declared or recognised by the relevant State or Territory authority.

**C.3** The relevant minimum wages for full-time junior and adult
apprentices provided for in this award, calculated hourly, will apply to
school-based apprentices for total hours worked including time deemed to be
spent in off-the-job training.

**C.4** For the purposes of clause C.3, where an apprentice is a full-time
school student, the time spent in off-the-job training for which the apprentice
must be paid is **25%** of the actual hours worked each week on-the-job. The
wages paid for training time may be averaged over the semester or year.

**C.5** A school-based apprentice must be allowed, over the duration of the
apprenticeship, the same amount of time to attend off-the-job training as an
equivalent full-time apprentice.

**C.6** For the purposes of this schedule, off-the-job training is
structured training delivered by a Registered Training Organisation separate
from normal work duties or general supervised practice undertaken on the job.

**C.7** The duration of the apprenticeship must be as specified in the
training agreement or contract for each apprentice but must not exceed 6 years.

**C.8** School-based apprentices progress through the relevant wage scale at
the rate of 12 months progression for each 2 years of employment as an
apprentice or at the rate of competency based progression where provided for in
this award.

**C.9** The apprentice wage scales are based on a standard full-time
apprenticeship of 4 years (unless the apprenticeship is of 3 years duration) or
stages of competency based progression where provided for in this award. The
rate of progression reflects the average rate of skill acquisition expected
from the typical combination of work and training for a school-based apprentice
undertaking the applicable apprenticeship.

**C.10** If an apprentice converts from school-based to full-time, the
successful completion of competencies (where provided for in this award) and
all time spent as a full-time apprentice will count for the purposes of
progression through the relevant wage scale in addition to the progression
achieved as a school-based apprentice.

**C.11** School-based apprentices are entitled pro rata to all of the other
conditions in this award.

NOTE: See clause D.4.2(e)
for calculating the actual minimum wage. See also clause D.4.3
for other minimum wage provisions that affect clause D.4.2(d).

(e)Calculating the actual minimum wage

**(i)** If fewer than 38 (or an average of 38) ordinary hours of work per
week is considered full-time at the workplace by the employer, the appropriate
minimum hourly rate for a part-time trainee is obtained by multiplying the
relevant minimum hourly rate in clauses D.4.2(a) to D.4.2(d) by 38 and then
dividing the figure obtained by the full-time ordinary hours of work per week.

**(ii)** If the approved training for a part-time traineeship is provided
wholly off-the-job by a registered training organisation, for example at school
or at TAFE, the relevant minimum hourly rate in clauses D.4.2(a)
to D.4.2(d) applies to each ordinary hour worked by the trainee.

**(iii)** If the approved training for a part-time traineeship is undertaken
solely on-the-job or partly on-the-job and partly off-the-job, the relevant
minimum hourly rate in clauses D.4.2(a) to D.4.2(d) minus 20% applies to
each ordinary hour worked by the trainee.

**D.4.3** **Other minimum wage provisions**

**(a)** Clause D.4.3 applies despite anything to the contrary in clause D.4.2.

**(b)** An employee who was employed by an employer immediately before
becoming a trainee with that employer must not suffer a reduction in their
minimum rate of pay because of becoming a trainee.

**(c)** For the purpose of determining whether a trainee has suffered a
reduction as mentioned in clause D.4.3(b), casual loadings are to be
disregarded.

**(d)** If a qualification is converted from an AQF Certificate Level II to
an AQF Certificate Level III traineeship, or from an AQF Certificate Level III
to an AQF Certificate Level IV traineeship, then the trainee must be paid the
next highest minimum rate provided in this schedule, if a higher minimum rate is
provided for the new AQF certificate level.

**D.4.4** **Default wage rate**

The minimum wage for a trainee
undertaking an AQF Certificate Level I–III traineeship whose training package
and AQF certificate level are not allocated to a wage level by clause D.6 is the relevant minimum wage under this schedule for a trainee undertaking an AQF
Certificate to Level I–III traineeship whose training package and AQF
certificate level are allocated to wage level B.

D.5Employment conditions

**D.5.1** A trainee undertaking a school-based traineeship may agree to be
paid an additional loading of 25% on all ordinary hours worked instead of being
paid annual leave, paid personal/carer’s leave, paid compassionate leave and
paid absence on public holidays. However, if the trainee works on a public
holiday, the public holiday provisions of this award apply.

**D.5.2** A trainee is entitled to be released from work without loss of pay
and without loss of continuity of employment to attend any training and
assessment specified in, or associated with, the training contract.

**D.5.3** Time spent by a trainee, other than a trainee undertaking a
school-based traineeship, in attending any training and assessment specified
in, or associated with, the training contract is to be regarded as time worked
for the employer for the purposes of calculating the trainee’s wages and
determining the trainee’s employment conditions.

**D.5.4** The time to be included for the purpose of calculating the wages for
part‑time trainees whose approved training is wholly off-the-job is determined
by clauses D.4.2(e)(ii) and D.4.2(e)(iii) and not by clause D.5.3.

**D.5.5** Subject to clause D.2.4, this award applies to a trainee in the same
way that it applies to an employee who is not a trainee, except as otherwise
expressly provided by this schedule.
