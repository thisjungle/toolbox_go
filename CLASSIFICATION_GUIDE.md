# CW/ECW Worker Classification Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to correctly determine the classification level for Construction Workers (CW) and Engineering Construction Workers (ECW) under the Building and Construction General On-site Award [MA000020].

## What are CW and ECW Classifications?

- **CW (Construction Worker)**: Workers in general building and civil construction sectors
- **ECW (Engineering Construction Worker)**: Workers in engineering construction (electrical, mechanical, fabrication)

Both classifications follow the same level structure (1-8) but apply to different sectors.

## Classification Principles (How to Determine Correct Level)

According to Award Schedule A.3.1, employers must consider:

### 1. Nature and Skill Requirements of the Position
- What tasks will actually be performed?
- What complexity level is involved?
- What equipment will be operated?

### 2. Skill Level and Certification of Employee
- What formal qualifications do they have?
- What certifications or licenses?
- What competency standards have they met?

### 3. Experience and Qualifications
- **Formal Training**: Trade certificates, modules, courses
- **Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL)**: Formal recognition of skills through experience
- **Work Experience**: Must be verified through competency testing
- **Indicative Tasks**: Can they perform tasks listed for that level?

### 4. Testing and Verification
- Construction Skills Tests
- Competency assessments
- Industry Training Board standards

## Important: Classification Must Match Actual Work

**The classification is based on:**
- The work the employee ACTUALLY performs
- The skills they ACTUALLY demonstrate
- NOT just their job title

**Example**: If you hire a qualified carpenter (Level 3) but they only perform basic laboring tasks, you cannot classify them as Level 3 just because they have the qualification. However, if they perform trade-level work, they must be classified (and paid) at Level 3 minimum.

## New Entrant Pathway

If an employee has NEVER worked in construction before:

1. **Day 1**: Level 1(a) - New entrant rate
2. **After 3 months**: Automatically progress to Level 1(b)
3. **After 12 months**: Automatically progress to Level 1(c)
4. **When training completed**: Progress to Level 1(d)

**Important**: Provide access to structured training so they can progress to Level 1(d) and beyond.

## Documentation Requirements

For workers claiming qualification-based classification:
- **Trade qualifications**: Provide trade certificate
- **Training modules**: Provide completion certificates
- **Portable long service**: May indicate industry experience
- **Superannuation records**: May indicate industry experience
- **RPL**: Must be formally assessed and documented

## Industry Allowances (MUST BE ADDED)

The minimum rates shown do NOT include industry allowances, which are compulsory:

- **General building construction**: $64.10/week
- **Civil construction**: $64.10/week
- **Engineering construction**: $64.10/week
- **Residential building**: $51.28/week

These allowances apply "for all purposes" of the award.

## Additional Allowances That May Apply

Depending on the work:
- **Tool allowances** (for tradespersons providing own tools)
- **Height allowances** (multistorey work)
- **Underground work allowance**
- **First aid allowance** (if qualified)
- **Leading hand allowance** (if supervising workers)
- **Special licenses** (e.g., electrician's license)
- And many others - see Award Schedule B

## Supervision Levels Explained

### General Supervision (Level 1)
- Receives detailed instructions
- Subject to regular progress checks
- Work reviewed frequently
- Requires ongoing guidance

### Limited Supervision (Level 2+)
- Receives clear objectives, less detailed instruction
- Work measured by achievement of objectives
- Fully competent in technical sense
- Requires little guidance day-to-day

## Skills Streams

Workers may work in one or more skill streams:

### General Construction Stream
- Carpentry and joinery
- Bricklaying and blocklaying
- Concreting
- Painting and decorating
- Plastering
- Tiling
- Roofing

### Civil Construction Stream
- Earthmoving
- Plant operation
- Road construction
- Pipeline laying

### Engineering Streams
- **Electrical/Electronic**: Wiring, motors, PLCs, telecommunications, instrumentation
- **Mechanical**: Machinery, fluid power, automotive, HVAC
- **Fabrication**: Structural steel, sheet metal, welding

## Common Classification Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Classifying by job title alone** - Must match actual work performed
2. **Ignoring qualification requirements** - Levels 3+ generally require trade qualifications
3. **Forgetting industry allowances** - These are mandatory, not optional
4. **Assuming experience = qualification** - Experience must be verified through competency testing
5. **Not providing training pathways** - Employers should facilitate progression
6. **Misunderstanding "general" vs "limited" supervision**

## Reclassification

If an employee believes they should be classified at a higher level:

1. Employee must demonstrate they possess required skills
2. May require competency testing
3. Must be performing work at that level
4. Follow dispute resolution procedures if disagreement
