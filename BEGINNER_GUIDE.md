```

Just answer the questions as they appear!

## What the Wizard Tells You

After answering the questions, you'll see:

1. **Classification Level** - e.g., CW/ECW 3
2. **Description** - What this level means
3. **Minimum Rates** - Weekly and hourly pay
4. **Key Duties** - What work they should do
5. **Next Steps** - How to progress to higher level
6. **Important Notes** - Industry allowances and verification

### Q: What if I make a mistake?
**A:** Just start over! Press `Ctrl+C` to exit and run it again.

### Q: How do I see the code?
**A:** Use this command:
```bash

nano main.go
# or
vim main.go
```

Then rebuild:
```bash
go build -o classification-wizard main.go
```
